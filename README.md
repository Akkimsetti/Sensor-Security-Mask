# Sensor-Security-Mask

**Abstract**

Corona or COVID-19 is a pandemic disease according to WHO. Coronavirus can be spread in many number of ways but primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from nose. The virus can attack the human body through eye, nose and mouth. The virus spread can be stop or minimized by sanitization and wearing masks etc.

**Problem Statement**

**To provide better security when a person accidentally touches his face.**

**Proposed Solution**

**An IOT based mask which alerts the person when he/she accidentally touches his face.**

The IOT based mask is an improvised version of normal medical mask which detects and alerts the user when he touches his face accidentally or intentionally. Normally children and old aged people always rub their fingers or hands on their face. This virus is more prone to children and old aged this solution can help them to minimize the risk.

**Objectives:**

- **Detects and Alerts the user when the user touches his face**
- **Portable**
- **Minimize the risk for virus attack**
- **Light weight**

**Origin of the proposal:**

**The main inspiration of this project came when children rub their hands on face frequently unintentionally. In addition to that on searching web the proposal of a spectacle which avoids touching of the head. The related work is referred at [https://www.hackster.io/nickbild/sentinel-2288e3](https://www.hackster.io/nickbild/sentinel-2288e3). People who are going out for their daily needs may touch many things in public places like malls, grocery shops and stores etc and accidentally touch their faces. In order to minimize that risk this proposed masks can be used effectively. According to Psychology Anxiety and Inferiority Complex has increased in people due to Corona. The people having these disorders touch frequently their facial parts like eyes, nose and ears without knowing. Apart from these Nail biting, Thumb sucking, Insertion of fingers in nose, ears and eyes is common in these people. Due to these reasons Corona spread raises. In order to minimize these situations, the proposed mask can be used.

**Methodology**

The proposed solution is an IOT based mask which contains IR (Infrared) Sensors and an Ultrasonic sensor which detects the obstacles (hands, fingers or any foreign object etc) and alerts the person who was wearing the mask. This setup also uses a microcontroller (Arduino) which process the sensor data and alerts through LED or a Buzzer. The sensors are fitted in the mask provided that there is no barrier for the user comfort. The IR sensors are fitted to portion of the mask which covers the below part of eyes. An ultrasonic sensor is fitted at the mouth portion of the mask. The IR sensor alerts when the user accidentally touches the upper part of the face (eyes, forehead etc) and the ultrasonic sensor alerts when the person touches the mask.

**Novelty**

“The Mask Protection” has never seen in our community before but now it is a part of our living. Antiviral mask should not be a burden and be protective, comfortable and even beauty enhancer. So, in future all facial gadgets, ornaments, clothing and other protection elements need this solution embedded in themselves. We hope that this solution should play a major role in decreasing the virus spread.

**Societal and Market Impact**

In this Corona time, Mask has become an essential part of our living. We are not going out without that so the proposed solution can be embedded with the mask which adds an additional layer of security for protection. Community spread occurs without knowing the origin in those cases protection is a major concern. Since people touches many things daily and may rub their hands against faces intentionally/ unintentionally which can cause corona. The proposed solution can be used as daily wear and it can be carried along with the user easily.

- Innovative items production with multipurpose use
- Low cost and simple technology in daily wear
- Very useful for human harmony
- Eco friendly
- Gives protection to all age groups
- Non hazardous
- Pollution free solution (device)
- Helps in small scale industry boosting

**Preliminary Work**

**A prototype has been made for the proposed solution. The prototype has built using a normal cloth mask and sensors. For this project we took a normal cloth mask and embedded two IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor into it. A Microcontroller (Arduino UNO) is used for processing and alerting the user. The working demo of the prototype is available at:**https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWcVnGU6VSqv-h0ayU1L8xPldDOrsI5G/view?usp=sharing**

**Proposed end-outcomes**


- Mask which avoids the touching of face
- Decrease the risk of Virus
- Increased Protection against Corona
